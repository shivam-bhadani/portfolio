<p class="mt-4">Online Assessment (OA) refers to the coding test which companies take to shortlist candidates for interviews.</p>

<p class="mt-2">It generally consists of 3-4 coding problems which we have to solve within a limited time (generally 1-2 hrs).</p>

<p class="mt-4">People who don't give contest on codeforces and rely on leetcode for their preparation often struggle to clear this test.</p>

<p class="mt-4">The best thing you can do is practice past OA problems which is available on <a href="https://thejoboverflow.com/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400">thejoboverflow.com</a>. Practice as many medium and hard tag problems from this site as possible.</p>
