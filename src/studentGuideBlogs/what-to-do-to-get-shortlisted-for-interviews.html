  What to do if you are applying a lot still not able to get shortlisted for interviews?
</h1>

<p class="text-lg mt-4">All the experiences here are for freshers and interns. If you are >= 1 yr experience, don't read this blog.</p>

<p class="mt-4">There are two types of companies, MNCs and Startups. I observed different patterns for both.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 py-2">MNCs:</h2>
<p>Here, applications are in very large numbers, means for 50 openings at least 1 lakh+ students apply.</p>
<p>According to my observation, resume doesn't matter here.
<p>Most influencers preach, this resume, that resume, this project etc got them interview, those things don't matter if you are fresher.</p>
<p>Weak resumes and strong resumes both have almost equal probability of shortlisting here.</p>
<p>Referral also doesn't work here. With or without referral both have almost equal probability.</p>
<p>You can't do anything to increase your chances. You only have to depend upon luck to get shortlisted here.</p>
<p>Note: This is for freshers. For experienced, referral works a lot. But this blog is only for freshers.</p>
<p>Applying directly on career portal (with or without referral doesn't matter) can fetch you interview based on only luck.</p>
<If>But the other way (and easiest way) to get into these companies is when they organise some offcampus hiring pool (hackathon/ coding contest). If you perform good in them then there are high chances that you will get interviews. Applications are in huge no. here also. So, a lot of luck involved here also but it is relatively easier than career portal because here you have some things on your hand to control.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 py-2">Startups:</h2>
<p>Number of startups that hire are a lot more than MNCs and pay is equally good. Getting interviews here is a lot easier than MNCs.</p>
<p>If your college doesn't have oncampus placement then focus on startups.</p>
<p>They generally hire based on "Dev" skills. So, focus on building good projects.</p>

<p>If you are applying for startups then try to apply on those which don't get viral on telegram. Because if an opening gets viral on telegram then again it will get 1 lakh+ spam applies and your resume will get lost in the crowd.</p>
<p>Then, the next question may be, how to find those startups which are hiring? In my off-campus blog, I shared some websites like ycombinator, wellfound, indeed etc. You can check on them and u can find many sites on internet which post openings (try to research it by yourself). Directly apply on those portals. But to increase chances after applying, u can ping employees / founders from those startups on LinkedIn/ email with your resume and skills. Here, skills and resume matter a lot. If u genuinely have good skills then you may get reply otherwise you will get ignored.</p>
<p>Also, try to message senior engineers that are working in random startups on LinkedIn. Messaging MNCs engineers might not help you because their company has a systematic way of hiring which involves HR/ shortlisting etc as I mentioned in MNC section.
<p>Make a message template which is short and simple with your skills and resume and send this to at least 50-100 random startup engineers daily on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>You only need one opportunity to get a job. Do a lot of hard work in applying/ messaging daily, then there are very high chances that you will get that opportunity in 2-4 months.</p>
