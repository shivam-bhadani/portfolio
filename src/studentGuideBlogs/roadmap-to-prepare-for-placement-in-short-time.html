  Wasted 2-3 years of college. What to do (DSA or Dev) in the remaining time to get good placement (DSA or Dev)?
</h1>

<p class="mt-4">Pick anything and don't waste any more time in researching what to study. You know yourself better, what is your strong area and what is best for you.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to hear my suggestion then you can read the below.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Basic DSA is compulsory so don't skip it. I told this earlier in my tweets that whichever field you go, at least do 300 leetcode qsn.</p>
<p>It would take around 3 months to complete 300 leetcode questions, if you are seriously studying and not doing timepass anymore.</p>

<p class="mt-4">After that:</p>
<p class="mt-4">If your college offers good on-campus opportunities, continue sharpening your DSA skills and do CP till your desired rating.</p>
<p class="mt-4">But if you don't have on-campus placement then focus on Dev. There are plenty of startups that hire based on development skills. Build solid projects and use them to secure job.</p>
