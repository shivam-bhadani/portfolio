<h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">What's the best way to use leetcode?</h1>

<p class="mt-4">This blog is for those who want to do DSA from leetcode and don't want to solve codeforces.</p>

<p class="mt-4">I always tell, number of questions don't have value. Always judge your skills from contests (weekly & biweekly) performance.</p>

<p class="mt-4">But the target should be to solve at least 100-150 leetcode hard to get accepted without seeing the solutions.</p>
<p>And do 4/4 problems in contests.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Now, it's up to you how many easy, mediums you require to get to that level.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Count only those lc hards in your solve count for which u haven't referred to any hint/solution.</p>
<p>Even if you solved 250 hards but if you seen solution/hint of 200 then your solve count is 50 only.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Summary of the blog:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 24px;">
  <li>Solve 100-150 leetcode hards without solution/hints.</li>
  <li>Solve 4/4 problems in most contests.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4">Try to stay away from clickbait posts like "Best way to utilise leetcode". Only way is to open problem -> code -> submit.</p>

<p class="mt-4">I don't share any shortcuts. I have given the targets for leetcode in this post. Now, it's up to you to complete it.</p>
<p>The only way to achieve this is through investing time and doing work.</p>
