  How to ask referral?
  <br />
  What kind of template is good and what mistakes to avoid?
</h1>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 py-2">Template:</h2>
<p>I am &lt;Your Name&gt;, 2024 graduate from &lt;Your College&gt;.</p>
<p>Job Link - Provide job link for which you want referral.</p>
<br />
<p>Why is this candidate good for this position?</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 24px;">
  <li>Write this in 3rd person. Write achievements and past experience.</li>
  <li>Write this in 70-80 words.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  Most referral portals ask the above question. So, if you give the above answer to the person you asked for referral, then he/she can copy-paste that answer. Make sure to write it in 3rd person.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 py-2">Mistakes to avoid:</h2>
<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 24px;">
  <li>Don&#39;t send Hi, Hello etc. Make sure to send complete message in one go.</li>
  <li>Always attach the Job Link for which you want referral.</li>
  <li>Give drive link of your resume instead of pdf. And make sure to give &quot;anyone can view&quot; access to the link.</li>
  <li>If you are not able to get referral then may be you are reaching out to less number of people. Revert back rate is very low so send referral message to at least 20-25 people on LinkedIn.</li>
  <li>If you want to take referral for any job link, don't apply. First, take referral, then a unique link will come in email inbox. Apply through that link. Sometimes, you don't need to apply after referral, depending upon company.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, in the wait of taking referral, opening gets closed. So, the solution is:<br />Direct apply through an Alt email and go for referral with a different email. So, even if you don't get referral in time, at least you have applied directly through an alt email.</li>
</ul>
